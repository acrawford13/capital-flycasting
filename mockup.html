                <p>The CIA should've just Googled for his hideout, evidently. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? In prison, you just have to close your eyes and take it, but here you have to close your eyes and give it. Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car?</p>

                <p>Saw this on the highway and almost blue myself. Hop on? Also, your knee is on my heart. I deceived you, mom. Tricked makes it sound like we have a playful relationship. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary and we don't need anymore lawsuits.</p>

                <p>I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run, so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. Mister gay is bleeding! Mister gay! It seems like only yesterday you were bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb. And don't make the water too hot. The scabs come right off.</p>
                <h2>Catch more fish</h2>
                <p>I am having a love affair with this ice cream sandwich. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard.</p>
                <p>I deceived you, mom. Tricked makes it sound like we have a playful relationship. Can't a guy call his mother pretty without it seeming strange? Amen. And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cute! I've been in the film business for a while but I just cant seem to get one in the can. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands.</p>
